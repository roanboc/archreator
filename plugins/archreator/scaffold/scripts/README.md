# Scripts

_[← Project home](../README.md)_

**Two validators and the parse they share.** They came with the scaffold, so
this project has had them since its first commit, and CI should run both on
every pull request.

```bash
python3 scripts/check_links.py    # relative links and HTML anchors resolve
python3 scripts/check_model.py    # element-ID references resolve
```

Both exit `0` when everything resolves and `1` otherwise, printing what failed.
They need nothing but Python — no network, no plugin installed, no packages —
which is the point: a project has to be able to check itself on its own.

| File | What it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `check_links.py` | Executable. Every relative Markdown link and every HTML `href`, `src` and `#fragment` points at something that exists |
| `check_model.py` | Executable. Every backticked element ID resolves to a definition, none is defined twice, none is both live and retired, a levelled ID has its parent defined, every document that defines an element declares how far it has been validated, no relationship table restates an element's name differently from the catalogue that defines it, and every reference that names another model either resolves in this repository or is declared in `architecture/imports.md` |
| `model_graph.py` | Library, imported by both. The single parse of the document convention — element IDs, catalogue tables, relationship tables, the resolution of a bare identifier inside a domain, and the neighbourhood walk the reading tools use |
| `element-prefixes.json` | Data, read by `model_graph.py`. The element-ID prefixes and what each stands for |

## Everything else runs from the method

Reading tools are not copied in here. They live in the archreator plugin and
read this project, which keeps one copy of each rather than a copy per project
that drifts from the method it came from:

```bash
model.py --project . trace BSVC1     # what a change here would touch
model.py --project . coverage        # what is not grounded, and what is not approved
model.py --project . portal          # a stock MkDocs config, for a reader outside the repo
build_brief.py --project . --element BSVC1 --focus impact
```

They import `model_graph.py` from **this** folder, so there is one parse of the
document convention and not two. Run one without a project and it says so.

## What they cannot do

`check_model.py` verifies that a *reference* resolves. `check_links.py`
verifies that a *link* resolves. **Neither reads what a "Realized by" cell
claims about a path**, so a cell naming a directory that no longer exists
passes both silently. `model.py coverage` finds the cell that is *empty*;
whether a path it names still exists is a step in the change process, not
something these scripts can do for you.

`coverage` prints and **always exits 0**. There is no `--strict`: telling a
repository path from a team name is fuzzy, and a check that fails wrongly
teaches people to ignore the checks that do not.

## Nothing is cached

There is no database and no projection anybody reads. Every tool parses the
Markdown fresh, which takes well under a second on the largest model built on
this method. There was a persisted graph once; in that same model it had gone
stale, and answered a question about the architecture from a revision that no
longer described it. A cache that is silently wrong is worse than no cache.

`model.py export` still writes `.model/model.json` for a consumer that
genuinely cannot read Markdown — a dashboard, a report — but nothing in the
method reads it back. Delete it and nothing is lost.

## Two folders the validators skip

`architecture/reference/` holds source documents as they were provided. A
transcript in which somebody says an element identifier is a person talking,
not a definition.

`architecture/scope/` and `architecture/decisions/` are skipped for the older
reason: a merged scope document is immutable and will outlive the elements it
names, so reference-checking it is incoherent rather than merely awkward.
