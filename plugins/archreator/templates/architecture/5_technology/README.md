# Technology Layer

_[← EA home](../README.md)_

The runtimes, tooling, and infrastructure that the
[application layer](../4_application/README.md) executes on.

## Analysis order

Files are numbered in the order they are analyzed: first _which technology
services exist and what provides them_, then _how the built artifacts reach
their runtime nodes_.

| #   | Document                                               | Elements                                                          | Question it answers                       |

| 1   | [1_technology-services.md](./1_technology-services.md) | Technology Services and the nodes/system software providing them | What infrastructure services are used?    |
| 2   | [2_deployment.md](./2_deployment.md)                   | Nodes, Artifacts, and the CI/CD deployment pipeline               | How does the build get to where it runs?  |

If no stack has been chosen yet — typical the first time this layer is
assessed for a new small project — use the `stack-selection` skill for a
decision framework and concrete defaults (static hosting vs. Supabase +
Vercel, etc.) before writing `1_technology-services.md`.
