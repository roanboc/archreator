# Application Layer

_[← EA home](../README.md)_

The software that realizes the
[business services](../2_business/2_business-services.md): application
services, the components providing them, how the components collaborate,
and — at the finest grain — the solution design and the contracts of every
interface/port.

## Analysis order

Files are numbered in the order they are analyzed, from the coarsest view
(services offered to the business) down to the finest (per-method interface
contracts). Not every project needs all five from day one — a small
project may only ever populate 1 and 2; add 3–5 when the component count or
the number of interchangeable adapters justifies the extra grain.

| 1   | [1_application-services.md](./1_application-services.md)             | Application Services and the business services they realize | What does the software offer the business layer? |
| 2   | [2_application-components.md](./2_application-components.md)         | Application Components, mapped to source files               | Which components provide those services?          |
| 3   | [3_application-collaborations.md](./3_application-collaborations.md) | Collaborations and interaction sequences                     | How do the components interact?                   |
| 4   | [4_solution-design.md](./4_solution-design.md)                       | Overall design, diagrams, patterns, tooling                  | How is the code structured, and why?               |
| 5   | [5_interface-contracts.md](./5_interface-contracts.md)               | Per-interface pre/postconditions, invariants, error behavior | What exactly does each interface promise?          |

`2_application-components.md` is where the **grounding rule** bites
hardest: every component row must point at the module/file that implements
it. `4_solution-design.md` is the natural place to document "how to add a
new X" recipes (a new port, a new adapter, a new platform) once the shape
repeats often enough to be worth writing down once.
