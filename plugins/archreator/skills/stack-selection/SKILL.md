# Choosing a stack for a small application

This is guidance for **deciding**, not a substitute for
`architecture/5_technology/README.md` — once a
choice is made, document it (and why) in
`1_technology-services.md`/`2_deployment.md` as usual. It exists because
for a small or solo project, the honest default answer to "what should we
build this on" is almost always one of a handful of well-worn combinations,
not a bespoke evaluation.

## Decision tree

1. **Does the app need to store or mutate shared state at all** (multi-user
   data, anything that outlives a single browser session)?
   - **No** → it's a static site/tool. Skip everything below about
     databases and auth entirely; see "No backend" below. This is the
     cheapest, simplest, and most secure option there is — don't add a
     backend "just in case."
   - **Yes** → continue.
2. **Does it need user accounts / access control?**
   - If the database choice below already bundles auth with row-level
     policies (e.g. Supabase), default to that instead of a separate
     auth provider — one less moving part, one less place for the
     permission model to drift from the data model.
   - Otherwise, pick a standalone auth provider (below).
3. **How much infrastructure control does the project actually need?**
   Small apps essentially never need this — default to managed/serverless
   and revisit only if a specific, concrete requirement (compliance,
   unusual compute, cost at real scale) demands it.

## No backend (static only)

Build to static files, ship on a free static host. Zero servers to secure,
zero ongoing cost, zero uptime to babysit.

| Need | Default | Alternatives |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ |
| Hosting | **GitHub Pages** (already versioned with the code, free, trivial GitHub Actions deploy) | Cloudflare Pages (faster edge, still free), Netlify |

This is the right choice for tools, demos, docs sites, and anything whose
state is fully client-side (`localStorage`, URL params) — no server means
nothing to secure, patch, or pay to keep running.

## Needs a backend (data, users, or both)

| Need | Default | When to reach for the alternative instead |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Database + auth + row-level access control** | **Supabase** (managed Postgres, built-in Auth, Row-Level Security policies enforced by the database itself rather than application code, generous free tier) | **Firebase** if the data is naturally document-shaped/NoSQL and you want faster prototyping over relational integrity; **PlanetScale/Neon** if you specifically want just a Postgres/MySQL database with no bundled auth (e.g. you already have an auth provider) |
| **Auth only** (already have a database, or the DB choice has no bundled auth) | **Auth.js (NextAuth)** if self-hosting is fine and the framework is Next.js | **Clerk** for the fastest setup and best out-of-box UI components, at the cost of a third-party dependency and its own free-tier limits |
| **App hosting / deploy** | **Vercel** for Next.js (zero-config, preview deployments per PR, generous free tier) | **Netlify** as a framework-agnostic equivalent; **Cloudflare Pages** for the cheapest/fastest option at real scale or if going all-in on the Workers ecosystem |
| **CI** | **GitHub Actions** (already assumed by this template's `write-pr-description` and `5_technology/2_deployment.md` conventions) | — |

**Reference combination** for "typical small app with users and real
data": **Next.js + Vercel + Supabase**. Vercel handles hosting/CI/CD via
its GitHub integration; Supabase provides Postgres with Row-Level Security
policies as the single point of access-control enforcement — document the
role × operation mapping in
the `architecture/2_business/README.md`
once the project's roles are known, so the RLS policies stay traceable to
that matrix.

## The model as data

The Markdown under `architecture/` is the **source of truth**: it is what the
Requester approves at the gates and what review acts on. The question this
section answers is what, if anything, should be derived from it.

**The default is nothing.** The graph is already implicit in the documents,
`grep` traverses it, and an agent reads Markdown natively — there is no
parsing gap to close for the reader the model is written for. A derived
store would be a second representation that can fall behind the first, which
is the drift `architecture-document-style`'s one-fact-one-place rule exists to prevent.

What *is* needed is **validation**, and that needs a parse, not a store.
`scripts/check_model.py` builds the graph in memory, checks that every
reference resolves and that no ID is reused, and exits. Nothing persists, so
nothing goes stale. This is the failure agents are worst at unaided: an
agent reading `relieves GAIN2` cannot cheaply tell that `GAIN2` was deleted
three initiatives ago, and will reason confidently from the stale reference.

### When a persisted projection becomes worth it

Reach for one only when one of these is actually true — and record the call
with a `record-decision`:

| Trigger | Why it changes the answer |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| The model no longer fits in one context read | An agent that must query rather than read needs something to query |
| Domains live in separate repositories | Federation needs an interchange format; an agent cannot `grep` a repo it hasn't cloned |
| A genuinely **transitive** question recurs | "Blast radius of retiring `CAP3`" is a traversal, not a lookup. One-offs are a script, not infrastructure |
| A non-agent consumer appears | A dashboard, a report, or a rendered model for stakeholders cannot read Markdown tables |

When that day comes, the default is **SQLite** as a `nodes`/`edges` pair
traversed with recursive CTEs — at the scale an EA model reaches (hundreds
of elements, edges in the low thousands, traversals a few hops deep) SQLite
*is* the graph database, and `sqlite3` ships with Python:

```sql
CREATE TABLE nodes(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, type TEXT, layer TEXT,
                   name TEXT, doc TEXT, realized_by TEXT);
CREATE TABLE edges(src TEXT, dst TEXT, rel TEXT);  -- realizes, serves, …
```

The projection is regenerated, never hand-edited, and `check_model.py`
already extracts what it would need — element IDs (`architecture-document-style` § Element
IDs) are what make it mechanical rather than a parsing exercise, which is
the reason to use them consistently from the first document.

Dedicated **embedded** graph databases are worth knowing about only once
SQLite has actually stopped being enough: [LadybugDB](https://ladybugdb.com/)
(the maintained successor to Kuzu — embedded, columnar, Cypher, interoperates
with DuckDB/Arrow/Parquet), [GraphLite](https://github.com/GraphLite-AI/GraphLite)
(Rust, embedded, implements the ISO **GQL** standard), and
[ArcadeDB](https://arcadedb.com/embedded.html) (embeddable on the JVM).
**Kuzu itself was archived in October 2025** after its team was acquired —
existing releases still run, but don't adopt it for new work. Both active
successors are young enough that betting an organization's shared model on
one is a real risk.

## Principles behind these defaults

- **Managed over self-hosted, by default.** A small app's traffic and data
  volume essentially never justifies operating a server, a database, or a
  Kubernetes cluster yourself. Reach for that only when a concrete,
  articulated requirement demands it — not as a default posture.
- **Free tier first.** Vercel, Supabase, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, and
  GitHub Actions all have free tiers generous enough for a small app's
  entire lifetime pre-scale. Don't commit to paid infrastructure before
  there's a concrete reason to.
- **Fewer moving parts beats more control.** A bundled database+auth
  product (Supabase) that removes an entire class of drift (auth logic
  disagreeing with data-access logic) is usually worth more than the
  flexibility of wiring the two together yourself.
- **Whatever is chosen, record it and the reasoning** in
  `architecture/5_technology/1_technology-services.md` — this skill helps you
  decide quickly, but the EA doc is what stays true and verifiable over
  the life of the project.
