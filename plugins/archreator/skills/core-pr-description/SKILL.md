description: Use when creating or updating a pull request in this repo. The PR body must follow the right template under .github/ (default or bugfix) and cover every change on the branch (diff against main) — never just the latest commit.

# Writing a PR description

## Cover the whole branch, always

Before writing (or rewriting) the body, gather what the branch actually
contains — the PR is reviewed and merged as a unit, so its description must
account for all of it:

```bash
git log --oneline main..HEAD      # every commit on the branch
git diff main...HEAD --stat       # every file the branch touches
```

If the branch carries more than one initiative, say so and link each scope
document; the Changes section then gets one subsection per initiative.

## Pick the right template first

- **Pure bug fix, no documented behavior changes** →
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/bugfix.md`.
- **Anything else** (adds or changes documented behavior) →
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` (the default).

If it's unclear which one applies, it isn't a pure bug fix — use the
default template and let the EA-alignment table make the "no change"
verdicts explicit instead of assuming them.

> The two templates live in different places on purpose: GitHub auto-fills a
> PR body only from the single default at `.github/pull_request_template.md`,
> and requires named alternates (the bug-fix one) to live in the

> place, or the default stops auto-filling.

## Follow the template

For the **default** template, fill every section:

- **Summary** — what the branch delivers, 2–4 sentences.
- **Scope document** — link the `architecture/scope/N_*.md` file(s) this branch adds
  or updates. Its Approvals table must already record the gates the change
  required (Gate 2 at minimum — see `core-architecture-first-change`); an empty table
  means the branch isn't ready for review. A pure bug fix may state "no
  scope document" with a reason (but should probably be using the bugfix
  template instead).
- **EA layers touched** — copy the verdicts from the scope document's
  alignment table; every layer gets one, including explicit "no change".
- **Changes** — grouped by work package/area, covering the full
  `main...HEAD` diff. If a file change isn't explainable here, it either
  needs a mention or doesn't belong on the branch.
- **Verification** — the commands run (lint, typecheck, tests, build) and
  their results, plus manual/end-to-end checks.
- **Out of scope / follow-ups** — mirror the scope document's gap notes.

For the **bugfix** template, fill every section instead: Bug, Root cause,
Fix, Regression coverage, Verification, Scope document (stating "pure bug
fix — no scope document").

## Keep it current

When you push more commits to a branch with an open PR, **update the PR
body** so it still describes the whole branch — the description is a living
document until merge, not a snapshot of the first push. Re-run the two git
commands above and reconcile.
